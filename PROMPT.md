We're going to write an insanely efficient and streamlined
single-author blogging platform.

The fundamental premise is that it serves one and only one blog post
at a time, inspired by finger/plan files from yesteryear.

From an author's perspective, they simply write to a plain text file
in markdown format, save the file, and then anyone can read their
current plan on the web.

The serving stack should be as optimal as possible. It should allow
the page to render as close to instantly as physically possible, using
every trick in the book to minimize rendering latency.

Your job is to design and implement the single-user, single-post
blogging platform. 

We will iterate on the design in a design doc called DESIGN.md and
keep track of state in TODO.md. 

You will be sure to always document your work for the user in
README.md.

You will always test and verify all the code you write before
returning control back to me.

If you have questions be sure to ask, but feel confident making
recommendations if you know a good solution, and just go ahead and do
something if you are 90% sure it's right.
